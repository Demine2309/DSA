	 * 1. Binary search Tree introduction
	 * * Quick terminology crash course
	 * - A tree is an undirected graph which satisfies any of the following definitions:
	 *		+ An acyclic connnected graph
	 *		+ A connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges
	 *		+ An graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path
	 * - If we have a rooted tree then we will want to have a reference to the root node of our tree.
	 * - It does not always matter which node is selected to be the root node because any does can root the tree!
	 * - A child is a node extending from another node. A parent is the inverse of this
	 * - A leaf node í a node with no children.
	 * * Which is a Binary Tree (BT)
	 * - A binary tree us a tree for which every node has at most two child nodes.
	 * * Which is a Binary Seach Tree (BST)?
	 * - A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the BST invariant: left subtree has smaller elements and
	 *	 right subtree has large elements.
	 * - BST operations allow for duplicate values, but most of the time we are only interested in having unique elements 
	 *	 inside our tree.
	 * * When and Where are Binary Trees used?
	 * - Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
	 *		+ Implementation of some map and sets ADTs
	 *		+ Red Black Trees
	 *		+ AVL Trees
	 *		+ Splay Trees
	 *		+ etc...
	 * - Used in the implementation of binary heaps
	 * - Syntax trees (used by compiler and calculators)
	 * - Treap - a probabilistic DS (uses a randomized BST)
